### About Dan Woodward (aka Woodybrood)

I'm a tester, developer, Apple fanboy, board gamer and former gamemaster. 

I am currently employed as a tester and develop tools for automated checking of my employer's products. Most of my work is in Java, but I still work in some ruby here and there.

For a while I was a contributor to the [FitNesse](http://fitnesse.org) testing tool. I'm still considered one, but I don't do a lot of FitNesse any more. 

As identified in [A Tester Should Know Better](/articles/2015/05/12/a-tester-should-know-better.html), I have a currently incurable cancer called Multiple Myeloma. It's a cancer of the blood where plasma cells over-produce. More about MM can be found at [The International Myeloma Foundation](myeloma.org) or [Multiple Myeloma Research Foundation](themmrf.org).
