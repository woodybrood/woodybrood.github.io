Just for kicks I ran the few posts I have through Tagxedo, and here is the
result:

Guess I talk about the same things a lot.

Try out Tagxedo at [http://www.tagxedo.com/](http://www.tagxedo.com/).

I will note, while trying it out, I think I found a bug with their tweet
functionality.  Of course they suggest the contents, but then I couldn't add
my own words to the tweet.  I could however, delete the contents. I don't know
if this is a side effect of a fresh Silverlight install or something else. But
my keyboard works everywhere else on my computer.

Sadly, I now have Silverlight installed as they apparenlty haven't re-
implmented in HTML5 yet.
