It's been a long time since I've posted. As it goes with a lot of folks who
think they want to blog, the commitment is hard to put ahead of family and
paying work. So, that said, I'm going to attempt a revival of my efforts here.
  
In the time since i last posted, a number of things have changed. The biggest
and most significant from a testing perspective is that I have gone back to my
previous employer. I had a great time as a consultant, but a number of things
have changed where I was and there is a whole new attitude on testing. It
isn't a perfect change, but it is an improvement.  
  
So I'm back. I'm digging into stuff I never thought I would use and developing
skills that haven't been the focus for me in the past. It's exciting stuff and
while I can't go into certain details. I will be posting my thoughts on
software testing and the tools I'm exploring. More posts will be coming soon.
