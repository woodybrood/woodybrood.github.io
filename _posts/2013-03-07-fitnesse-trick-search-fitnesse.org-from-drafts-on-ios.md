title: 'FitNesse Trick: Search fitnesse.org from Drafts on iOS'

I'm a bit obsessive about tryng to answer questions related to FitNesse on
[StackOverflow.com](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/fitnesse) and on
the [FitNesse Yahoo Group](http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/fitnesse/).
There are plenty that I can't answer, but I try to answer if I can.  This
habit comes into play even when all I have is my phone.

So in, drafts I created this action called Search Fitnesse.org with Chrome and
used the following URL

> googlechrome://google.com/search?q=site:FitNesse.org%20[[draft]]

The following should work with safari:

> http://google.com/search?q=site:FitNesse.org%20[[draft]]

Using either of these, I can quicky find what I want from the fitnesse.org
site, copy it and paste it back into my response.
