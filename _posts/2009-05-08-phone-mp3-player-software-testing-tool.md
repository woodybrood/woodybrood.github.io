title: "Phone?  MP3 Player?  Software Testing Tool?"

So often the focus on tools in software testing is on automation of GUIs, web
testing, or even unit testing. Sometimes you hear about a little tool that has
a special purpose that is very focused, such as AllPairs or PerlClip (via
[Satisfice](http://www.satisfice.com/tools.shtml)).

How about a tool that you carry in your pocket? The iPhone and iPod Touch have
revolutionized the smart phone industry. And, while the app store isn't about
to do the same to software testing, it is pretty interesting how a tester can
occasionally benefit from having a multi-purpose tool like an iPhone or iPod
Touch at hand.

So you ask, how can you use one to test? Let's explore a couple of common
tools I like to have in my pocket for testing:

Safari  
A web browser is always a handy tool. Assuming you can get on the network at
the office with a Touch, or have an iPhone You can:  

  * Look stuff up on Google.com  
  * Try out your non-iPhone web application for usability on an iPhone
  * Kick off a FitNesse test (probably need wi-fi access for this one).

I don't know about you, but I've often kept a stop-watch at hand to keep track
of how long it takes for the software to do something. Having a reliable time
piece to check loading time or responses can give you ammunition in a
discussion later. Sometimes I haven't had that stop watch with me when I
wanted it. Now I always have one with me. Technically I have one in my regular
phone, but it is very clumsy.

[Evernote](http://itunes.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewSoftware?id=2
81796108&mt=8) (free)  
Ubiquitous capture. That's what Evernote is good for. I use the Evernote
client on my iPod Touch, my Windows computer and my Mac at home. If I had an
iPhone, I could get pictures of the software behaving badly on someone else's
computer. With my Touch, I can take notes in a meeting, at a co worker's desk
or when I'm at lunch and have those notes for use later. You never know when
inspiration will strike.

[PCalc Lite Calculator](http://itunes.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/view
Software?id=300311831&mt=8) (free)  
A calculator is always a useful tool. Checking math is a common occurrence in
testing. Sure, you could use the one in windows. But that thing is ancient.
And it doesn't support RPN. OK, so i don't use the RPN option. I tried, but it
didn't work. I'll try again later.

[Read It Later](http://itunes.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewSoftware
?id=309597402&mt=8) (free)  
Take your favorite Testing and Software Engineering thinkers with you. Don't
be stuck with nothing to read when waiting in line for lunch. Catch up on
Exploratory Testing, Agile Acceptance Testing, Scrum, or even what something
neat from [arstechnica](http://arstechnica.com/). Either install the extension
to Firefox or use a bookmarklet to select what you want to read later, and
next time you sync up it will be waiting for you. There is a pay version that
add some nice features. [Instapaper](http://itunes.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStor
e.woa/wa/viewSoftware?id=284942713&mt=8) is a nice alternative.

[9-Toolbox](http://itunes.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewSoftware?id=
307094023&mt=8) (free)  
Nothing like a handy tool that does the job of nine. Date calculator. Count-
down clock (to release deadline or vacation?). Currency converter. And Unit
conversion. All are nice to haves, though probably not infinitely useful.

Summary  
So that's a list of some interesting options. By no means an exhaustive list.
There are great ToDo apps, vim reference, html references, accessing
[safaribooksonline.com](safaribooksonline.com) via the web, and it's even nice
to use to listen to music while you work.

I love my iPod Touch. It is amazingly useful. Does everyone need one? No.
Can't I do all of this with another tool, or even with paper? Yes. Is it the
next place the tool vendors will go? I doubt it. Anyways, Apple won't allow
capture-replay on the iPhone.

Now if no one beats me to it, I have an idea for an app.
