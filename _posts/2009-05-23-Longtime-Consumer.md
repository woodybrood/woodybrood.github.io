So, I've been using a range of open source tools for a long time now.&nbsp; Vim, Eclipse, FitNesse, FreeMind, TuxPaint (for the kids), and even a little bit of Ubuntu.&nbsp; I haven't really contributed much back to the communities I've particpated in as a consumer.

Today I put forth my first child into the world.&nbsp; I created a syntax coloring script for Vim/gVim.&nbsp; It's still pretty&nbsp; rough.&nbsp; I have some more slim and Fit/FitNesse syntax to support.&nbsp; I also should add some FitLibrary support, even though I don't use that.

If you love FitNesse, and you use Vim, it's a natural.&nbsp; So far that isn't too many people.&nbsp; As of this posting, only 5 people have downloaded it.&nbsp; And none of those are a vanity download.

If you are interested, you can find it here: [http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script\_id=2651](http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=2651).
