title: 'FitNesse Trick: Search fitnesse.org from Drafts on iOS'
---

<p>I'm a bit obsessive about tryng to answer questions related to FitNesse on <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/fitnesse">StackOverflow.com</a> and on the <a href="http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/fitnesse/">FitNesse Yahoo Group</a>. There are plenty that I can't answer, but I try to answer if I can. &nbsp;This habit comes into play even when all I have is my phone.</p>
<p>So in, drafts I created this action called Search Fitnesse.org with Chrome and used the following URL&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>googlechrome://google.com/search?q=site:FitNesse.org%20[[draft]]&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The following should work with safari:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>http://google.com/search?q=site:FitNesse.org%20[[draft]]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Using either of these, I can quicky find what I want from the fitnesse.org site, copy it and paste it back into my response.</p>
