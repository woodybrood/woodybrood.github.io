<p>Just for kicks I ran the few posts I have through Tagxedo, and here is the result:</p>
<p><span class="full-image-block ssNonEditable"><span><img style="width: 600px;" src="/images/WhoTestedThisCloud.png" alt="" /></span></span></p>
<p>Guess I talk about the same things a lot.</p>
<p>Try out Tagxedo at http://www.tagxedo.com/. &nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12px;">I will note, while trying it out, I think I found a bug with their tweet functionality. &nbsp;Of course they suggest the contents, but then I couldn't add my own words to the tweet. &nbsp;I could however, delete the contents. I don't know if this is a side effect of a fresh Silverlight install or something else. But my keyboard works everywhere else on my computer.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12px;">Sadly, I now have Silverlight installed as they apparenlty haven't re-implmented in HTML5 yet.</span></p>
