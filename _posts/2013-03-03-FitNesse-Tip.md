I monitor the&nbsp; [FitNesse Yahoo Group](http://groups.yahoo.com/group/fitnesse/messages "FitNesse Yahoo Group")&nbsp;and do my best to answer questions there. I can’t answer them all, as there are many uses of FitNesse that I have little to no experience in (for example, CSlim). I do like to help though when I can.

Unfortunately, folks don’t always provide enough information. it’s a common trap that we all suffer. We use something so much in one specific way, and we forget that other folks might use it differently. Or we are working with something that seems so basic, but forget a little detail that will help someone respond faster.

The committers worked together and we came up with this message that we will be sending out on a regular basis to that list to help remind folks how to ask for help.

> Welcome to the FitNesse Yahoo Group. FitNesse is a fully integrated standalone wiki, and acceptance testing framework, and this is the official discussion group for it. It is important to note that FitNesse supports multiple languages and a number of test fixture styles. The range of languages and options makes it really important to provide as much information as possible. A wide range of FitNesse users read this list, and they are very willing to help ­ and they can only help you, if you help them to understand your problem.

The important thing to understand in lists like the FitNesse yahoo group is folks really want to help. We don’t have a strict monitoring policy, yet people are civilized and do their best to help when they can. And the best way to get someone to help you, is to enable them to do so.
