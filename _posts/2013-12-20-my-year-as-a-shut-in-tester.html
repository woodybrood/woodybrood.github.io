title: My Year as a Shut-In Tester
---

<p>This week I celebrated my one year anniversary at my job. Last December I said goodbye to going into a traditional office, and hello to a small team of professionals that I only see face to face once a year. That&#8217;s right, I joined the world of the home-worker, the remote worker, the telecommuter. And thus I have spent a year as a shut-in.</p>

<p>OK. I&#8217;m kidding. I&#8217;m not a shut-in. It&#8217;s true that I don&#8217;t leave the house to go to work, but I do leave the the house. I just don&#8217;t have to do it every day. </p>

<p>Seriously though, home-working is a challenging and rewarding thing to do. It helps that I work with a great bunch of folks. It helps that the company has a strong concept of life-work balance. It helps that I consider myself an introvert and I don&#8217;t mind being by myself a lot. </p>

<p>I&#8217;m not an expert on working from home, but I&#8217;d like to share a few thoughts about my experiences:</p>

<ul>
<li>Working from home means not having to commute. Not that my old commute was long, but I still don&#8217;t miss it.</li>
<li>Working from home does not mean working without pants. I get up, get the kids going, exercise, shower, shave and get dressed; just like if I was going to go somewhere. Of course the dress code at my house forces me to wear a lot of <a href="http://shirt.woot.com">Woot Shirts</a>.</li>
<li>It gives me the flexibility to get the kids on the bus and be there when they get home.</li>
<li>I can run out for groceries at lunch sometimes (see I leave the house) and either make dinner or have stuff in the house for my wife to cook.</li>
<li>Working from home requires discipline. No one is watching you to remind you to be on track. You have to be responsible.</li>
<li>I can listen to any music I want to, without headphones. Well, if the kids are home I try to keep it clean. I have very sensitive ears and have never found headphones I really liked.</li>
<li>Reliable internet is essential. It is very frustrating that my cable modem reboots 1&#8211;2 times a day. I have written a script to log it. I even have a chart (and it&#8217;s not pretty).</li>
<li>Working from home is not enough by itself. Your employer has to support it well and your co-workers need to understand it. Where I work, we&#8217;re all remote, so we all know what it is like.</li>
<li>Work/life balance is hard in today&#8217;s always connected world. Don&#8217;t let the fact you work from home let your work take over. I have the fortune of having a boss (one of the compay owners) that has snarked at me when he caught me reading email on a Sunday night and my direct boss is very concerned that folks take their comp time.</li>
<li>It&#8217;s a little scary taking a job with someone that you don&#8217;t meet face to face first. I think if I hadn&#8217;t known my boss through collaborating on FitNesse, I would have been too freaked out.</li>
</ul>

<p>If you find the right opportunity, and you can deal with lots of time by yourself, there are a lot of good things about working from home. Do your research. Check out the company and be sure of what you are getting into. </p>

<p>Also learn more about home-working. There is a great podcast called <a href="http://www.70decibels.com/homework/">Homework</a> that has a lot of great advice for telecommuters and freelancers. When I decided to take this job, I started listening to their back episodes and have been a listener ever since. It really helped me prepare for some challenges and is full of great tips.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s been a great year. I haven&#8217;t even discussed the fact that I&#8217;ve transitioned from a technical, non-testing role that I enjoyed a lot, back into a tester in the trenches. I&#8217;ve enjoyed that a lot, as that is a part of my career that I hadn&#8217;t focused enough on in some time. I&#8217;ll talk more about that in another post, which I hope to get to soon.</p>

<p>And finally, a big &#8220;thank you&#8221; to my wife. When this opportunity came along, she fully supported me making the jump to a new way of working.</p>
